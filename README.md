# product-card
This a very basic card for a web component workshop I did for teaching.
So, basically this card receives parameters such as title, image, etc

## Installation
Make sure you have Node/npm cli installed. Then, just type the following command:
```bash
$ npm install product-card-carloscdev
```

## Usage
Add a <product-card> element to your page and set the convenient parameters as attributes that the component needs in order to get styled a card.
For e.g:
```html
  <product-card
    title="SHELL"
    color="BLUE"
    description="The Spiny Shell, also sometimes referred to as the Blue Shell, is an item that debuted in the second Mario Kart title,
    Mario Kart 64, and has been in every Mario Kart game since."
    price="49"

  ></product-card>
```
